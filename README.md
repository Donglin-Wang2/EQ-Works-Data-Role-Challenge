# Data role challenge submission from Donglin Wang
For this challenge, I chose the Apache Spark route. I answered both questions from the Data Science problem set (problem 4a.1 and 4a.2) as well as the Pipeline Engineering problem set (problem 4b). To set up the environment locally, run `docker-compose up` and follow the instruction in the terminal to access the jupyter notebook server from the browser. After that, if the `DonglinWangApacheSparkSubmission.ipynb` file is not present in the server, then manually upload the `DonglinWangApacheSparkSubmission.ipynb` file through the browser so that it is at the same directory as the `/data` folder.
